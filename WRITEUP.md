# Project Write-Up

This documents decribe my way around to the first project of Udacity Intel AI Edge Nanodegree Program

## Explaining Custom Layers

Custom layers are layers that are not included in the list of known layers. If your topology contains any layers that are not in the list of known layers, the Model Optimizer classifies them as custom.

The process behind converting custom layers involves the following.

- Generate the Extension Template Files Using the Model Extension Generator
- Using Model Optimizer to Generate IR Files Containing the Custom Layer
- Edit the CPU Extension Template Files
- Execute the Model with the Custom Layer

## Comparing Model Performance

My method(s) to compare models before and after conversion to Intermediate Representations
were...

The difference between model accuracy pre- and post-conversion was...

The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

The inference time of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

Each of these use cases would be useful because...

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
  
- Model 2: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...

- Model 3: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
